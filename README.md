# Visuelle Geschichten mit Code und Daten

The mini code projects as well as the final website were created as part of the "Visuelle Geschichten mit Code und Daten" course during the winter term 22|23 under the supervision of Lucas Vogel. The solo work consist of creative coding algorithms written with p5js, a final website presenting the results and a GitHub repository containing the code.
