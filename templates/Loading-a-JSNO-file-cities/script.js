// This is advanced. Ingnore if needed.
// We define an asynchronouse function, meaning
// it will not stop the execution of the program

// why is the loadJSONFile input () called "path" and not "jsonURL": 
// The loadJSONFile function stores the jsonURL content in the new path variable. This is because the path variable is ought to be used ONLY in this function. 


async function loadJSONFile(path) {
  // We pause the execution of the loadJSONFile function
  // Until the fetch function has finish executing
  // This is made with the await keyword
  // And we save the result of fetch into the let response
  let response = await fetch(path)
  // We wait until the response is parsed into a JSON
  // format and we save the result in a let json
  let json = await response.json()
  jsonContents = json // We override our global variable jsonContents with the results
  console.log(jsonContents) // We log the results for convenience
}

// await and fetch are both built in JavaScript functions. It means they are saved in the browser and can just be used by me by typing the magic word "await". I do not need to write this function by myself.
